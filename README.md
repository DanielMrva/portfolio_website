# portfolio_website
DJM portfolio website homework (week 2 HW)
## Notes
This website was build based on prompts from the DU 6-month Full-Stack-Flex coding bootcamp.

Site projects do not include any "real" projects, but instead use dummy images and generic text.  Links will go back to the main page (due to lack of deployed content availbile) but will be updated once other projects are deployed.  Email link also goes to #null as well, but will eventually work as a contact form (as I don't want to give out my email on the open web).

The basic idea for this project was to deploy a reactive portfolio site.
